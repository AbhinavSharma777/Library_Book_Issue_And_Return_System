A simple Library Issuing system that gives us five choices to operate on the console. 

1.Add Book
2.Show All Books
3.Show Available Books
4.Borrow Book
5.Return Book

These all options are displayed on the console. Once the work has been completed, it also shows us a option to "EXIT" the whole loop.

It also maintains an in-built list of all the books that are currently in the Library but only for any specfic session.
